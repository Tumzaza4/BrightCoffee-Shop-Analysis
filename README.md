This project analyzes Bright Coffee Shop’s transactional data to help the new CEO understand revenue performance, peak sales periods, and product trends. Using Snowflake SQL, Excel dashboards, and a structured planning process, the project delivers clear insights and recommendations for improving sales. Key Outputs: I used Miro Diagram to do Data flow & Planning. Cleaned and transformed dataset on Snowflake, attached SQL scripts for all processing steps and Excel analysis showing top revenue-generating products, best and worst sales time intervals, and high-performing vs underperforming items dashboards with revenue, product, and time-based insights. These results are shown on an executive presentation with findings and recommendation.
